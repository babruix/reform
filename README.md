# Reform [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/franleplant/reform.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/franleplant/reform)

Form validation library for react

> THIS IS A  PROTOTYPE

## Design Goals

There's a hole in the React ecosystem regarding Form Validation.
While there are very nice solutions such as [redux-form](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form), they tend
to be pretty minimal, verbose and difficult for beginners.

The main objectives of **Reform** are:
- Minimal, declarative and HTML5 compliant validation API
- Extensibility: validate anything you need to, the way you want to
- HTML5 compliant validation rules out of the box: `required`, `pattern`, input type `email`, etc


In a sense **Reform** is a port of HTML5 validation primitives to the React world
while maintaining common React Idioms.

People familiar with Angular 1 forms will feel at home here.
